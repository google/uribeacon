/*
 *  HAL_ASSERT( expression ) - The given expression must evaluate as "true" or else the assert
 *  handler is called.  From here, the call stack feature of the debugger can pinpoint where
 * the problem occurred.
 *
 *  HAL_ASSERT_FORCED( ) - If asserts are in use, immediately calls the assert handler.
 *
 *  HAL_ASSERT_STATEMENT( statement ) - Inserts the given C statement but only when asserts
 *  are in use.  This macros allows debug code that is not part of an expression.
 *
 *  HAL_ASSERT_DECLARATION( declaration ) - Inserts the given C declaration but only when asserts
 *  are in use.  This macros allows debug code that is not part of an expression.
 *
 *  Asserts can be disabled for optimum performance and minimum code size (ideal for
 *  finalized, debugged production code).  To disable, define the preprocessor
 *  symbol HALNODEBUG at the project level.

 *  This macro compares the size of the first parameter to the integer value

 *  negative array size occurs (even gnu chokes on negative array size).
 *
 *  This compare is done by creating a typedef for an array.  No variables are
 *  created and no memory is consumed with this check.  The created type is
 *  used for checking only and is not for use by any other code.  The value
 *  of 10 in this macro is arbitrary, it just needs to be a value larger
 *  than one to result in a positive number for the array size.
